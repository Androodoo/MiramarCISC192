Challenges I faced while coding this assignment:
1) One big challenged that I faced was in the entire chunk of code from lines 34-60. The syntax was a little bit tricky but after a few repetitions it became a smooth process.
2) Another challenged I faced was realizing that in the division case, I needed to include a dividing by zero error, so I added an if statement to point out if a number is being divided by zero.
3) A challenge that I'm currently facing is keeping the program running after trying to divide by zero. In java class, I think we used a while loop to keep the program running but we haven't learned it in this class. I'm also on a time crunch so I will figure this out after I submit this assignment.
